# jekyll-action
A GitHub Action to build and publish Jekyll sites to GitHub Pages

Out-of-the-box Jekyll with GitHub Pages allows you to leverage a limited, white-listed, set of gems. Complex sites requiring custom ones or non white-listed ones (AsciiDoc for intstance) used to require a continuous integration build in order to pre-process the site.

## Usage

### Create a Jekyll site
If you repo doesn't already have one, create a new Jekyll site:  `jekyll new sample-site`. See [the Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/) for more information. In this repo, we have created a site within a `sample_site` folder within the repository because the repository's main goal is not to be a website. If it was the case, we would have created the site at the root of the repository.

### Create a `Gemfile`
As you are using this action to leverage specific Gems, well, you need to declare them! In the sample below we are using [the Jekyll AsciiDoc plugin](https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc)

```Ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'jekyll', '~> 3.8.5'
gem 'coderay', '~> 1.1.0'

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-asciidoc', '~> 2.1.1'
end

```

### Configure your Jekyll site
Edit the configuration file of your Jekyll site (`_config.yml`) to leverage these plugins. In our sample, we want to leverage AsciiDoc so we added the following section:


```yaml
asciidoc: {}
asciidoctor:
  base_dir: :docdir
  safe: unsafe
  attributes:
    - idseparator=_
    - source-highlighter=coderay
    - icons=font
```

Note that we also renamed `index.html` to `index.adoc` and modified this file accordingly in order to leverage AsciiDoc.

### Use the action
Use the `helaili/jekyll-action@master` action in your workflow file. It needs access to a `JEKYLL_PAT` secret set with a Personal Access Token. The directory where the Jekyll site lives will be detected (based on the location of `_config.yml`) but you can also explicitly set this directory by setting the `SRC` environment variable (`sample_site` for us).

Note that it might be a good idea to use the `actions/bin/filter` action so the site is built only when a push happens on `master`.

```js
workflow "Jekyll build now" {
  resolves = [
    "Jekyll Action",
  ]
  on = "push"
}

action "Jekyll Action" {
  uses = "helaili/jekyll-action@master"
  needs = "Filters for GitHub Actions"
  env = {
    SRC = "sample_site"
  }
  secrets = ["JEKYLL_PAT"]
}

action "Filters for GitHub Actions" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@b2bea0749eed6beb495a8fa194c071847af60ea1"
  args = "branch master"
}

```

Upon successful execution, the GitHub Pages publishing will happen automatically and will be listed on the *_environment_* tab of your repository.

Just click on the *_View deployment_* button of the `github-pages` environment to navigate to your GitHub Pages site.

### Known Limitation
Publishing of the GitHub pages can fail when using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret instead of the `JEKYLL_PAT`. But it might work too :smile:
