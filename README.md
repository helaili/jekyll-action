# jekyll-action
A GitHub Action to build and publish Jekyll sites to GitHub Pages

Out-of-the-box Jekyll with GitHub Pages allows you to leverage a limited, white-listed, set of gems. Complex sites requiring custom ones or non white-listed ones (AsciiDoc for intstance) used to require a continuous integration build in order to pre-process the site.

Note that this is a rather simple (naive maybe) Docker based action. @limjh16 has created [a JS based version of this action](https://github.com/limjh16/jekyll-action-ts) which saves the container download time and might help with non default use cases. 


## Usage

### Create a Jekyll site
If you repo doesn't already have one, create a new Jekyll site:  `jekyll new sample-site`. See [the Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/) for more information. In this repo, we have created a site within a `sample_site` folder within the repository because the repository's main goal is not to be a website. If it was the case, we would have created the site at the root of the repository.

### Create a `Gemfile`
As you are using this action to leverage specific Gems, well, you need to declare them! In the sample below we are using [the Jekyll AsciiDoc plugin](https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc)

```Ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'jekyll', '~> 3.8.5'
gem 'coderay', '~> 1.1.0'

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-asciidoc', '~> 2.1.1'
end

```

### Configure your Jekyll site
Edit the configuration file of your Jekyll site (`_config.yml`) to leverage these plugins. In our sample, we want to leverage AsciiDoc so we added the following section:

```yaml
asciidoc: {}
asciidoctor:
  base_dir: :docdir
  safe: unsafe
  attributes:
    - idseparator=_
    - source-highlighter=coderay
    - icons=font
```

Note that we also renamed `index.html` to `index.adoc` and modified this file accordingly in order to leverage AsciiDoc.

### Use the action
Use the `helaili/jekyll-action@master` action in your workflow file. It needs access to a `JEKYLL_PAT` secret set with a Personal Access Token. The directory where the Jekyll site lives will be detected (based on the location of `_config.yml`) but you can also explicitly set this directory by setting the `jekyll_src` parameter (`sample_site` for us). The `SRC` environment variable is also supported for backward compatibilty but it is deprecated.
If your Gemfile is located in a directory other that root (for example, in docs directory of the repo), you should update `jekyll_src` input parameter accordingly.

Use the `actions/cache` action in the workflow as well, to shorten build times and decrease load on GitHub's servers

```yaml
name: Testing the GitHub Pages publication

on:
  push
    
jobs:
  jekyll:
    runs-on: ubuntu-16.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Use GitHub Actions' cache to shorten build times and decrease load on servers
    - uses: actions/cache@v1
      with:
        path: vendor/bundle
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-gems-${{ hashFiles('**/Gemfile.lock') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-gems-

    # Standard usage
    - uses:  helaili/jekyll-action@2.0.1
      env:
        JEKYLL_PAT: ${{ secrets.JEKYLL_PAT }}
    
    # Specify the Jekyll source location as a parameter
    - uses: helaili/jekyll-action@2.0.1
      env:
        JEKYLL_PAT: ${{ secrets.JEKYLL_PAT }}
      with:
        jekyll_src: 'sample_site'
```

Upon successful execution, the GitHub Pages publishing will happen automatically and will be listed on the *_environment_* tab of your repository.

Just click on the *_View deployment_* button of the `github-pages` environment to navigate to your GitHub Pages site.

### Known Limitation
Publishing of the GitHub pages can fail when using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret as the value of the `JEKYLL_PAT` env variable, as opposed to a Personal Access Token set as a secret. But it might work too :smile:
